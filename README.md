## Image Recognition Project using TensorFlow and Keras ##

Developed an image recognition system using TensorFlow and Keras to classify objects across various categories, regardless of background context. Built an interactive user interface with Streamlit and implemented the machine learning model using Python.

### how to run:
1] run the model.py file entirely first.

2] run the gui.py.

3] An interface will appear, and an image belonging to these classes will be uploaded.

4] The result will be shown on the top of the image.
